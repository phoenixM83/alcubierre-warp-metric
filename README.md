# alcubierre-warp-metric
Educational simulations and calculations related to the Alcubierre warp metric using Python
# Alcubierre Warp Drive — Didactic Version

This repository contains a very simple and educational Python script
to demonstrate the basic idea behind the Alcubierre warp metric.

## What this project is
- A didactic numerical example
- A conceptual simulation
- A learning exercise

## What this project is NOT
- Not a real warp drive
- Not engineering
- Not practical physics

## Goal
Show how abstract physics ideas can be represented using basic math and code.
